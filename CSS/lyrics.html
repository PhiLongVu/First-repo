    <pre>
        <del>We're talking away</del>
        <mark style = "background-color: aqua;">I don't know what I'm to say</mark>
        I'll say it anyway
        Today is another day to find you
        Shying away

        <span style = "background-color: blue;">I'll be coming for your love, okay?
        Take on me (take on me)
        Take me on (take on me)
        I'll be gone</span>
        In a day or two
        So needless to say
        I'm odds and ends

        <div style = "background-color: blue;">But I'll be stumbling away
        Slowly learning that life is okay
        Say after me
        It's no better to be safe than sorry
        Take on me (take on me)
        Take me on (take on me)</div>
        I'll be gone

        In a day or two
        All the things that you say, yeah
        Is it life or just to play my worries away?
        You're all the things I've got to remember
        You're shying away
        I'll be coming for you anyway
        Take on me (take on me)
        Take me on (take on me)
        I'll be gone in a day
        Take on me (take on me)

        Take me on (take on me)
        I'll be gone (take on me, take on me)
        In a day (take me on, take on me)
        Take on me (take on me)
        Take me on (take on me)
